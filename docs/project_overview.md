# ScrumTeam Metrics Dashboard

## Project Overview

The ScrumTeam Metrics Dashboard is a comprehensive analytics platform designed to provide visibility into team performance across 10 scrum teams and approximately 100 team members. The dashboard integrates data from JIRA and Git repositories to provide a holistic view of productivity, planning effectiveness, and development workflows.

## Business Goals

1. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor story point completion across teams and individuals
2. **Development Analytics**: Track coding contributions, PR reviews, and commit activity
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Understand the relationship between planning (JIRA) and execution (Git)
4. **Team Comparison**: Benchmark team performance and identify best practices
5. **Individual Contributions**: Recognize high performers and identify team members who may need support

## Key Features

1. **Integrated Data Sources**:
   - JIRA v2 REST API integration for story point tracking
   - Git/GitHub API integration for development metrics

2. **Multi-level Analytics**:
   - Organization-wide overview
   - Team-specific metrics
   - Individual contributor performance

3. **Correlation Insights**:
   - Story point to commit ratio analysis
   - Planning to execution consistency tracking
   - Velocity and throughput measurements

4. **Interactive Dashboards**:
   - Customizable date ranges
   - Team and member filtering
   - Data export capabilities

## Technology Stack

1. **Frontend**:
   - Next.js for server-side rendering and API routes
   - React for component-based UI
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Recharts for data visualization

2. **Backend**:
   - Next.js API routes as a proxy to external APIs
   - Type-safe API integration with TypeScript
   - Domain-driven design for business logic

3. **External Integrations**:
   - JIRA v2 REST API
   - GitHub/GitLab API

## Project Timeline

The project will be developed in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: JIRA integration and story point analytics
2. **Phase 2**: Git/GitHub integration and development metrics
3. **Phase 3**: Correlation analytics and comprehensive dashboards
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced reporting, customization, and exports

## Team Structure

The project will be developed by the following teams:

1. **Frontend Team**: Responsible for UI/UX, component development, and data visualization
2. **Backend Team**: Responsible for API integration, data transformation, and business logic
3. **DevOps Team**: Responsible for deployment, monitoring, and infrastructure
4. **UX/UI Team**: Responsible for design, user testing, and accessibility

## Key Stakeholders

1. **Development Managers**: Track team performance and identify bottlenecks
2. **Scrum Masters**: Monitor sprint progress and team velocity
3. **Product Owners**: Correlate story point estimation with actual development effort
4. **Team Leads**: Assess individual contributions and coaching opportunities
5. **Executives**: High-level overview of development organization productivity
