# ScrumTeam Metrics Dashboard Architecture

## Domain-Driven Design Architecture

The ScrumTeam Metrics Dashboard follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to ensure a clear separation of concerns and alignment with business domains. The architecture is structured around bounded contexts that reflect the natural divisions in the metrics analytics domain.

## Bounded Contexts

### 1. JIRA Analytics Context
Responsible for managing JIRA-related data and analytics.

**Domain Entities**:
- Team
- TeamMember
- Sprint
- Issue (with Story Points)
- CompletionStats

**Value Objects**:
- StoryPointValue
- SprintDuration
- CompletionPercentage

**Aggregates**:
- TeamStoryPointAggregate
- SprintCompletionAggregate

**Repositories**:
- TeamRepository
- SprintRepository
- IssueRepository

**Services**:
- JiraService
- StoryPointsAnalyticsService

### 2. Git Analytics Context
Responsible for managing Git-related data and analytics.

**Domain Entities**:
- GitRepository
- GitCommit
- PullRequest
- CodeReview
- Developer

**Value Objects**:
- CommitHash
- CommitMessage
- TimeToMerge
- ReviewResponse

**Aggregates**:
- RepositoryActivityAggregate
- DeveloperContributionsAggregate

**Repositories**:
- GitRepositoryRepository
- CommitRepository
- PullRequestRepository

**Services**:
- GitHubService
- GitAnalyticsService

### 3. Integrated Metrics Context
Responsible for correlating data between JIRA and Git contexts.

**Domain Entities**:
- IntegratedTeamMetrics
- IntegratedMemberMetrics
- CorrelationInsight

**Value Objects**:
- EfficiencyRatio
- VelocityMeasurement
- ConsistencyScore

**Aggregates**:
- TeamPerformanceAggregate
- OrganizationMetricsAggregate

**Repositories**:
- IntegratedMetricsRepository

**Services**:
- CorrelationService
- InsightGenerationService

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Domain Layer
Contains the domain model, business logic, domain services, and interfaces.

### 2. Application Layer
Contains application services, DTOs, and orchestrates the domain layer.

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
Contains implementations of repositories, external service adapters, and technical concerns.

### 4. Presentation Layer
Contains UI components, controllers, and user interface logic.

### 5. API Layer
Provides RESTful endpoints for accessing application functionality.

## Hexagonal Architecture

The application follows a hexagonal (ports & adapters) architecture:

- **Core Domain**: Contains pure business logic
- **Primary Adapters**: UI components, API controllers
- **Secondary Adapters**: JIRA API client, Git API client, database repositories
- **Ports**: Interfaces for adapters to interact with the domain

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Scheduled jobs pull data from JIRA and Git APIs
   - Data is transformed into domain entities

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Domain services apply business logic to calculate metrics
   - Correlation analysis between different data sources

3. **Data Presentation**:
   - API endpoints expose processed data to frontend
   - Frontend components visualize data in dashboards

## Technical Architecture

The application uses a Next.js-based architecture:

- **Frontend**: React components with Tailwind CSS
- **API Routes**: Next.js API routes providing backend functionality
- **API Clients**: Typed clients for external services
- **Data Access**: Repository pattern for data retrieval and storage

## Deployment Architecture

The application will be deployed as a Next.js application with the following components:

- **Web Application**: Serves the frontend and API routes
- **Database**: Stores processed metrics and user preferences
- **Cron Jobs**: Scheduled tasks for data synchronization with external systems
- **Authentication**: Integration with organization SSO
